# Welcome - I'm Chris!

## A little bit about myself
I don't like tooting my own horn, so I'll try to keep this brief and to the point. I like to think of myself as an engineer, recently graduated from the University of Washington Seattle's Materials Science & Engineering Bachelors program (in 2019). Despite my training being firmly rooted in the physical sciences, I have always been a computer geek, which is why my current repertoire of in-development projects are strictly software-focused. With that said, I've always found it to be a bit incongruous at the best and confused at worst to have a reigning interest in "software engineering" as such -- software, at least how I perceive it, is only useful insofar the software establishes a full solution or makes the problem-solving process easier in some fashion for some difficult problem residing in some other domain, say, materials science. With that in mind, my overriding interest in all things computers, software, and algorithms has always been directed, at least to some extent, towards solving real engineering problems, or real human problems. I respect those who confine themselves to the cultivation of incredible expertise with respect to software and computers, without ever transgressing any domain boundaries to leverage their virtuosity in real engineering problems, but to put it bluntly, that's not me.

Now, having put those unsolicited thoughts in the open, a more brief and perhaps relevant overview of my background: As mentioned, I received an education in Materials science & Engineering, but my current work on the various projects I have in stow has had the auxillary effect of making me progressively more competent as a software engineer, which in terms of my career, is the position I see myself assuming in the near future in solving difficult engineering problems, wherever it might be.

## What am I working on?
