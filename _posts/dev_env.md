# My Development Environment & Workflow

This is going to be an infrequently-updated loook into my development environment and some of the tools I use to get work done on my computers most often.

## Text Editor: Neovim, Kakoune

I use Neovim for just about all of my text editing needs, and it covers many of my needs beyond simple scripting and coding work. Whenever possible, I use (Neo)vim for anything from writing emails, to writing (like I'm doing right now with this post) to building out a personal wiki. While such a broad range of use cases might lend itself to a more hefty editor like Emacs, I've come to be most comfortable doing any remotely development-oriented work from the terminal, and as such, terminal-based text editors tend to be most familiar and comfortable ot me.

I also very occasionally use [Kakoune](kakoune.cr), which is essentially Vim with a selection-first instead of motion-first movement philosophy. It also has a much smaller community and less abundant ecosystem, which is why despite its powerful tools and interesting philosophy, I always tend to come back to (Neo)vim, although I'd certainly like to learn to become more fluent with Kakoune as time goes on.

### Neovim Setup

#### Plugins

I use (Neo)vim with a number of different plugins installed to make it more amenable to software development

#### Key mappings
